- `large-print-tube-map.png`: the original image I based my map off of.

- `large-print-tube-map.xcf`: a GIMP file which contains my modifications to the map.

- `naptan.json`: NAPTAN information for stations, produced by `get_stops.py` in the `tfl-api` folder.

- `tube_data.txt`: data for the map. The format is proprietary and somewhat rigid. It's probably easiest to just look at the file to figure out its syntax. Note that wherever double quotes appear, they are required.
